## Phase 1 — Repository and data foundation

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-01-repository-and-data-foundation.md`

- [ ] Task 1: bootstrap settings, version bundle, CLI, and handoff/source checks in tests/CI
- [ ] Task 2: implement source manifest and streaming workbook reader with row lineage
- [ ] Task 3: normalize domestic bonds and domestic listed products
- [ ] Task 4: normalize overseas listed products and public funds with quarantine
- [ ] Task 5: build Parquet/DuckDB artifacts, exact links, quality report, and reproducibility check
- [ ] Phase 1 gate passed

## Phase 2 — Deterministic query, policy, evidence, and answer engine

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-02-deterministic-query-engine.md`

- [ ] Task 1: domain contracts and registry loaders
- [ ] Task 2: entity resolution and exact cross-source links
- [ ] Task 3: QueryPlan semantic validator and allowlisted SQL compiler
- [ ] Task 4: repositories/executor and differential reference
- [ ] Task 5: state, metric, comparability, and conditional dual-lens policy
- [ ] Task 6: evidence, claim verifier, deterministic Korean renderer, and core service
- [ ] Phase 2 gate passed

## Phase 3 — HyperCLOVA X planner and evaluation API

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-03-hcx-planner-and-api.md`

- [ ] Task 1: HCX client and recorded contract fixtures
- [ ] Task 2: structured/strict JSON planner, repair, and rule fallback
- [ ] Task 3: API application, exact `/answer`, health/readiness/version, and safe errors
- [ ] Task 4: bounded timeout/retry/concurrency/cache and structured observability
- [ ] Task 5: Docker/reproduction and end-to-end API tests
- [ ] Phase 3 gate passed

## Phase 4 — Evaluation, hardening, proposal evidence, and release

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-04-evaluation-and-release.md`

- [ ] Task 1: canonical golden set and scoring harness
- [ ] Task 2: paraphrase, metamorphic, differential, quality, and adversarial suites
- [ ] Task 3: ablation and latency/load/resilience/soak measurement
- [ ] Task 4: competition compliance and independent review closure
- [ ] Task 5: clean-room reproduction, immutable release manifest, and submission freeze
- [ ] Phase 4 gate passed

## Current next task

**Phase 1, Task 1.** Follow the phase plan under strict TDD. Do not start later tasks in the same uncontrolled change.

## Handoff validation record — not production implementation

Observed on 2026-08-07:

- `python tools/verify_handoff.py` — PASS: 61 required files, 9 official inputs.
- `python tools/audit_source_data.py --check` — PASS: 145,393 source rows, snapshot 2026-07-11.
- `python tools/extract_schema_catalog.py --check` — PASS: 207 columns.
- `pytest -q` — PASS: 7 handoff contract tests.
- `python -m compileall -q src tools tests` — PASS.
- `python -m tools.verify_handoff` — PASS; handoff tools are importable as modules as well as executable scripts.
- JSON/YAML parse check — PASS: 8 schemas and 8 policy/config files.
- `uv.lock` is not included. A real `uv lock` attempt failed because the artifact environment could not resolve the package registry/Python download host. The first network-enabled bootstrap must resolve dependencies, generate and commit the lock file, then change CI installation to `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`; never hand-author a lock file.
- Dependency metadata was cross-checked before handoff; notably the Polars lower bound was corrected to the published `1.43.0` release. Ruff and mypy were not available in the artifact environment and remain Phase 1 bootstrap checks.

See `docs/13_HANDOFF_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`. These checks validate the handoff package, not the production system.

## Work log

No production implementation commands or commits have been recorded yet. The first Codex session must append actual failing/passing tests, command outputs, commit hash, risks, and next task below this line.
